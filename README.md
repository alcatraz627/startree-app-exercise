Author: [@alcatraz627](https://github.com/alcatraz627)

Purpose: Simple React Application demonstrating the use of various common functionalities used in a frontend react application

## Screenshot

## Running the application

This project was developed using `yarn`, so it is recommended that yarn be used to generate the build as well.

-   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
-   Install yarn on your system
-   Run `yarn` to install packages
-   Run `yarn build` to generate a static build in the `dist` directory
-   Run `yarn host:build` to serve the build files on a static server
    > Any alternative static server can be used to host the static files as well
-   Navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (should be `http://localhost:3000` if no configuration has been changed)

## Further Improvements

-   [ ] Fix the import aliasing issue in tsconfig.json
-   [ ] Set up selectors for the store
